## Flamous development

**Local development**

Flamous Music uses Parcel as its build tool. To run the project locally clone the Git repository with your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Flamous/flamous-music.git`. Move into the newly cloned directory: `cd flamous-music`, `npm install` to get the dependencies and `npm start` to start local developement server. Now open [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) in your browser and start hacking!
