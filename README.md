# How to Contribute

## Help with Testing
The newest development version of Flamous Music is live at **[next.flamous.io](https://next.flamous.io)** so we can try new features and find issues before they get to the main version. Please open issues here on GitHub if something is broken, you find bugs, or want some feature/have an idea for improvement.

## Help with Code

Then change directory `cd flamous-music` and install all project dependencies with `npm install` (requires Node.js being installed first). Finally, to see the site in action run `npm start` and open http://localhost:1234/ in your browser.You can start playing with the code and see the changes in your browser right away!

**Used technologies**
Other technologies used in Flamous Music are Hyperapp, Popmotion, AmplitudeJS, Babel, Modern Normalize, Picostyle, WorkboxJS, Vanilla Lazyload, StandardJS and RealFaviconGenerator. Huge thanks to each and every one of these projects <3
